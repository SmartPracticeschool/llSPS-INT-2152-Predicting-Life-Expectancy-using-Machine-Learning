project scope report
Predicting Life Expectancy Using Machine Learning
Project Summary- 
The project tries to create a model based on data provided by  the World Health Organization (WHO) to evaluate the life expectancy
for different countries in years. The data offers a timeframe through which model can be train.It is a A typical Regression Machine 
Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future.This project  provides a way to predict average life
expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, 
expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given.
